YOLOv8 Training on Aquarium Dataset
This repository contains the code for training a YOLOv8 model on the "Aquarium" dataset, specifically underwater images, to perform object detection tasks. The model is trained using Roboflow for dataset management, Google Colab for cloud-based training, and WandB for tracking training metrics.

Installation
To set up this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install ultralytics roboflow wandb
Libraries
ultralytics: The library for training YOLOv8 models.
roboflow: The library to access and download datasets from Roboflow.
wandb: A tool to log and visualize training metrics.
Dataset
The dataset used for training is an underwater image dataset provided by Roboflow. It contains various underwater objects and animals, and the dataset is pre-processed and formatted to YOLOv8 specifications.

To download the dataset, the script uses Roboflow's API key and project details. You need to set up your Roboflow API key to access the dataset.

python
Copy code
rf = Roboflow(api_key="your_api_key")
project = rf.workspace("yolo-xubfv").project("underwater_image")
version = project.version(1)
dataset = version.download("yolov8")
Training Configuration
The training is conducted using the YOLOv8 architecture with the following settings:

Model: YOLOv8n (small version for quicker training)
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 20
Learning Rate: 0.01
Image Size: 320 (resized for better performance)
The configuration is designed for quick experimentation. You can modify hyperparameters to tune for better performance on specific tasks.

Augmentations
The dataset undergoes several augmentations, including:

Horizontal flip
Rotation
Brightness adjustment
These augmentations help improve the model's generalization capability and make it more robust to variations in underwater images.

Hyperparameters
During training, we set the following hyperparameters:

Epochs: 20 – Provides enough time for the model to learn from the dataset without overfitting.
Batch Size: 32 – A moderate batch size that ensures stable training without exceeding memory limits.
Learning Rate: 0.01 – A moderate learning rate that helps the model converge without overshooting.
Image Size: 320 – Images are resized for efficient training.
Output Metrics
After training, we evaluate the model using the following metrics:

Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the ability to capture all positive instances.
mAP@50: Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold 0.5.
mAP@50:95: Mean Average Precision averaged across multiple IoU thresholds (0.5 to 0.95).
These metrics help evaluate how well the model detects and classifies objects.

Sample Results
Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.80
mAP@50: 0.75
mAP@50:95: 0.72
These values are subject to change based on the training run.

Usage
Training the Model:

Install the necessary dependencies using pip install ultralytics roboflow wandb.
Download the dataset from Roboflow.
Set up the YOLOv8 model and train it on the dataset using the provided script.
Viewing Metrics:

Training metrics like Precision, Recall, mAP@50, and mAP@50:95 are logged and can be viewed using WandB.
Visualize these metrics through the WandB dashboard.
Visualizing Results:

After training, the code generates plots comparing Precision, Recall, mAP@50, and mAP@50:95 against the epochs. These can be helpful to understand how the model's performance evolves.
Saving the Model:

After training, the best model weights are saved as best_model.pt for later inference or deployment.
